//Code Function:
The Person class:

Represents a person with two private attributes: name and age.
Provides getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.
Includes a sayHello method to print a greeting.
The Persontest class:

...Key Concepts
//Clean Code: Writing clear, organized, and easy-to-maintain code.
//Encapsulation: Protecting data by making fields private and accessing them through public methods (getters and setters).

//Constructor:
Special method called when creating an object.
Same name as the class, no return type.
Supports overloading (multiple constructors with different parameters).

//Getters and Setters: Control access to private fields, ensuring data consistency and validation.
//Shadowing: Occurs when a local variable has the same name as an instance variable. Use this to reference the instance variable.
